This Telegram bot allows users to convert images into a PDF document with a simple and user-friendly interface. The bot supports multiple languages, including English, Russian, Polish, Kyrgyz, and Uzbek. If you'd like to add more languages, just let me know by emailing jakhongirtojiev2003@gmail.com!

Features:
Language Selection: The bot greets users with a prompt to choose their preferred language from the following options: English, Russian, Polish, Kyrgyz, or Uzbek.

Image Upload: After selecting the language, users can send multiple images (in any format) that they want to convert to a PDF. The bot will confirm each image received and ask if the user wants to send more images or finish the process.

PDF Conversion: Once the user confirms they are finished, the bot will convert all the received images into a PDF file.

Rename PDF: After the conversion, users are given the option to rename the PDF file. If they choose to rename it, the bot will prompt them for a new name. If not, it will proceed to send the generated PDF with the default name.

File Delivery: The final PDF file is sent back to the user, either with the original or the newly assigned name, and the bot will thank them for using the service.

The bot runs 24/7, ensuring seamless service for all users.
